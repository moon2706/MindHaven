# 🛠️ Smart Petrol Bunk & Air Filler Station Tracker

## 🚀 Overview

**Smart Petrol Bunk & Air Filler Station Tracker** is an innovative real-time tracking platform that improves transparency and efficiency at fuel stations. It enables users to:

- 🔍 Check **if a petrol bunk is open or closed**
- 🔧 Monitor the **working condition of air filler stations**
- 🧭 Access **distance, ETA, and navigation** info directly on a map

By leveraging **IoT**, **GPS**, and **real-time databases**, this solution aims to modernize traditional fuel stations into **smart, data-driven service hubs**.
