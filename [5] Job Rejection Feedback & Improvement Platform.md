# 📢 Job Rejection Feedback & Improvement Platform

## 📌 Overview
This project aims to create a **third-party platform** that helps job seekers receive **automated feedback** on their job rejections. Instead of vague rejection emails, applicants can understand why they weren’t selected—whether it was due to ATS (Applicant Tracking System) filters, missing skills, or test performance. The platform will integrate AI-driven insights to provide constructive feedback, helping candidates improve for future applications.

- **ATS Score Analysis** – Breakdown of why a resume was rejected and missing keywords.
- **Skill Gap Detection** – Identifies missing skills based on job requirements.
- **Test Performance Insights** – Highlights areas of improvement in coding and MCQ tests.
- **Comparison with Selected Candidates** – Shows how a candidate performed relative to others.

- **Privacy & Anonymity** – Securely handles candidate data with GDPR compliance.
- **Integration with Companies** – Optional feature for companies to provide structured feedback.
- **Gamification & Learning Suggestions** – Personalized learning paths to bridge skill gaps.
