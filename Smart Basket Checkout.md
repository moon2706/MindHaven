# Smart Basket Checkout System using OpenCV and CCTV Integration

## Overview
This project introduces a Smart Basket Checkout System that leverages OpenCV and CCTV cameras for product detection and automatic cart management. Products are detected and added to a virtual cart as they are placed into a uniquely identifiable basket. This eliminates the need for manual scanning and provides a seamless shopping experience.

## Key Features
- **Smart Basket Identification:** Each basket has a unique ID (QR code or RFID) for tracking.  
- **CCTV Integration:** Overhead cameras monitor product movements using OpenCV.  
- **Real-Time Product Recognition:** Automatically detects and identifies products using AI-powered object detection.  
- **Seamless Cart Management:** Products are added to a virtual cart instantly without scanning.  
- **Flexible Payment Options:** Customers can checkout using a mobile app or at a self-service kiosk.  

## How It Works
1. **Unique Basket ID:** Customers receive a basket with a QR or RFID tag linked to their session.  
2. **Product Detection:** CCTV cameras capture product movements using OpenCV.  
3. **Automatic Cart Update:** Products are recognized and added to the customerâ€™s virtual cart.  
4. **Billing Process:** Customers can scan their basket ID at the counter or use an app to view and pay for their products.  

## Advantages
- **Faster Checkout:** Eliminates waiting in queues by automating the billing process.  
- **Enhanced Shopping Experience:** Reduces friction and offers convenience to customers.  
- **Efficient Store Management:** Tracks inventory in real-time and prevents theft using AI surveillance.  
- **Eco-Friendly:** Reduces paper receipts with digital invoicing.  

## Future Enhancements
- Implement AI-powered product price comparison.  
- Enable voice-controlled shopping assistance.  
- Add personalized product recommendations based on shopping history.
