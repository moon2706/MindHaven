# Secure QR Code-Based Vehicle Information System

## 🚀 **Overview**
This project proposes a QR code-based vehicle information system to streamline vehicle verification while ensuring privacy and security. The QR code will store essential information about the vehicle, accessible by authorized personnel or the owner via a secure authentication system.

## 🎯 **Objective**
- Provide a seamless and paperless vehicle verification system.
- Enable real-time access to vehicle information.
- Ensure data privacy using encryption and role-based access.

## 🧑‍💻 **Key Features**
1. **Encrypted QR Codes**: Each vehicle will have a unique, encrypted QR code on the number plate.
2. **Role-Based Access Control**: Law enforcement officers can access detailed vehicle data, while the public can view limited information.
3. **Password-Protected Access**: Owners can set a password, such as the chassis number or a user-defined key, for additional security.
4. **Dynamic QR Codes**: The QR code regenerates periodically to prevent misuse.
5. **Real-Time Status Check**: Data on pollution checks, insurance, and pending challans is instantly accessible.
6. **Blockchain Integration**: Ensures data immutability and security.

## 🔒 **Security Features**
- **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**: Uses biometrics or OTP verification for secure data access.
- **Limited Data Exposure**: Public scanning only reveals basic data like pollution status and challans.
- **Owner Notification**: Owners receive alerts when their vehicle's QR code is scanned.
- **Temporary Access Tokens**: Generate one-time-use codes for specific cases.

## 🧱 **System Architecture**
1. **Frontend**: 
    - Mobile app for scanning QR codes.
    - Web portal for authorities and owners.
2. **Backend**: 
    - Secure API to validate requests and provide appropriate data access.
3. **Database**: 
    - Stores encrypted vehicle information with blockchain integration.
4. **Authentication Service**: 
    - Handles password management, MFA, and access authorization.

## 📖 **Data Stored in QR Code**
- Vehicle Registration Number (Partially Visible)
- PUC Status
- Insurance Status
- Pending Challans (Count Only)
- Encrypted Link to Detailed Data

## 🔍 **Workflow**
1. User scans the QR code using an authorized app.
2. The app authenticates the user through password or chassis number verification.
3. Based on the user's role (e.g., owner, police, general public), appropriate data is displayed.
4. The owner is notified if sensitive information is accessed.

## 🌱 **Future Enhancements**
- **Geo-Tagging**: Track stolen vehicles using QR code scans.
- **Integration with National Vehicle Database**: Enable cross-state verification.
- **Emergency SOS Feature**: Notify authorities in case of emergencies.
