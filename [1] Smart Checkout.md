# Smart Checkout System using OpenCV and Motion Detection

## Overview
This project proposes a Smart Checkout System using OpenCV for real-time QR code and price detection. Instead of scanning each product manually at a counter, a camera setup captures video footage and detects QR codes and product details instantly. This ensures faster checkout processes and reduces the need for human intervention.

## Key Features
- **Real-time Detection:** Uses OpenCV for motion detection and QR code recognition.
- **Efficient Billing:** Automatically captures product details and updates the cart.
- **Reduced Manual Effort:** Eliminates the need for traditional barcode scanners.
- **Enhanced Customer Experience:** Speeds up the billing process and reduces wait times.
- **Cost-Effective:** Requires fewer checkout counters and staff.

## How It Works
1. **Camera Setup:** Install cameras at checkout counters or designated areas.
2. **Motion Detection:** OpenCV detects when a product is placed under the camera.
3. **QR Code Recognition:** Extracts product details like price and name.
4. **Cart Update:** The product details are added to the customerâ€™s virtual cart.
5. **Payment:** Customers can pay at the counter or using a mobile app.

## Future Enhancements
- Integration with AI for anomaly detection.
- Personalized discounts based on product recognition.
- Voice-assisted checkout for improved accessibility.
